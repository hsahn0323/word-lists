# word-lists

An application to aid in vocabulary and language learning.

The user can input and store words that they encounter and aren't familiar with. Once stored, accessing a word will provide a definition, synonyms, and an example of that word in a sentence.

Our app will include a basic UI to add and remove words. We may eventually implement an iOS and Android Version, but initially we will stick to Android.
